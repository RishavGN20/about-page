            <p>Hue Noir is on a mission to change the face of beauty by putting
                multicultural women at the center of the modern beauty movement. Blending COLOR + SCIENCE + TECHNOLOGY,
                we develop innovative, everyday makeup solutions ideal for
                customers with nuanced skin tones ranging from fair to deep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Multicultural women have long been challenged to find
                high-caliber cosmetics in shades that work with their skin tones
                while providing long-lasting benefits like oil absorption, moisturization and extended wear. Hue Noir
                set out to give women more choices and better options for achieving their desired look, developing
                formulas designed specifically for the varied and unique complexions among women of color. Our True Hues
                Flawless Finish
                Foundation, for instance, is available in 25 true-to-skin-color shades.
                Further, our products are formulated to emphasize a woman’s natural beauty while nourishing and
                protecting her skin.

                        Hue Noir was founded by Paula Hayes, a product chemist and woman of color inspired by
                        the challenge of finding quality cosmetics that complemented her complexion.
                        Personally aware of the beauty industry’s limited makeup options for her
                        and women like her, Paula embarked on a mission to rethink cosmetic
                        formulas and put multicultural women at the center.

                        with darker complexions and trusted for their consistent high quality.
